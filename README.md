2012's word of the year: GIF.
--------

(According to the [Oxford dictionary](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/11/gif-word-of-the-year/) anyway... )

I like to use GIFs in day to day communication, and whilst being pretty bummed out by [Aaron Swartz's death](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=aaron%20swartz%20death), it felt like a good time to look at finding GIFs easier.

This lets you search the net, and do an infinite scroll on a bunch of subreddits /tumblrs that are a good source for GIFs.
